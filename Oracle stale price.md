# Oracle stale price

**Name:** Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated

**Description:** Chainlink price feed latestRoundData is used to retrieve price feed from chainlink. We need to makes sure that the answer is not negative and price is not stale.

**Mitigation:** latestAnswer function is deprecated. Instead, use the latestRoundData function to retrieve the price and make sure to add checks for stale data.

```// Function to test the potentially unsafe retrieval of price data from a price feed
    function testUnSafePrice() public {

```
